        "abstract": "Over the last decade educational games have become more and more popular. There are many games specifically designed as educational games, as well as a number of entertainment games that have been successfully used for educational purposes. The EduGameLab project aims to stimulate the use of games in the classroom. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of game-based learning and focuses specifically on empirical evidence on the effectiveness of using games in education in the last decade. Moreover, the study focuses on usage in formalized school contexts, i.e. pre-school, elementary school, secondary school, high school and higher education. As secondary aims we also assess whether there are any clear methodological trends and whether a link could be found between the outcome of empirical studies and the evaluator being a stakeholder in the game development.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the effects of a learning game, [The Math App] on the mathematics proficiency of middle school students. For the study, researchers recruited 306 students, Grades 6\u20138, from two schools in rural southwest Virginia. Over a nine-week period, [The Math App] was deployed as an intervention for investigation. Students were assigned to game intervention treatment, and paper-and-pencil control conditions. For the game intervention condition, students learned fractions concepts by playing [The Math App]. In the analysis, students\u2019 mathematical proficiency levels prior to the intervention were taken into account. Results indicate that students in the game intervention group showed higher mathematics proficiency than those in the paper-and-pencil group. Particularly, the significantly higher performances of intervention groups were noted among 7th graders and inclusion groups. The empirically derived results of the reported study could contribute to the field of educational video game research, which has not reached a consensus on the effects of games on students\u2019 mathematics performance in classroom settings.",

        "abstract": "This study addresses the learning of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) concepts by physical education and sport science students through a computer game. Its aims are: (a) the design of the prototype of a computer game aimed at supporting the development of an appropriate mental model about how a computer works by the students, and (b) the evaluation of the impact of the use of this prototype on students as to appeal, basic usability issues and learning outcomes. The most significant elements of the game prototype (narrative, characters, interface, scenarios, puzzles, gameplay) are presented in connection with the constructivist learning principles that guided the game design. A hundred and three (103) physical education and sport science students participated in the evaluation of the game prototype, which was conducted through pretest and posttest written questionnaires that elicited both quantitative and qualitative data. The data analysis showed that the game prototype was well-accepted as an alternative learning tool for ICT, compared to traditional learning tools, and that most game elements elicited average to positive responses from the students. It was also found that the game prototype had a significant positive effect on students\u2019 knowledge regarding the concepts of input, program, output and their interplay, and that it helped certain students overcome their misconceptions and form more scientifically acceptable and elaborate mental conceptions about basic functions of a computer. Future improvements and extensions to the game as well as future research perspectives are discussed on the basis of the findings.",

        "abstract": "Networked Urban Screens offer new possibilities for public health education and awareness. An information video about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was combined with a custom browser-based video game and successfully deployed on an existing research platform, Screens in the Wild (SitW). The SitW platform consists of 46-in. touchscreen or interactive displays, a camera, a microphone and a speaker, deployed at four urban locations in England. Details of the platform and software implementation of the multimedia content are presented. The game was based on a psychometric continuous performance test. In the gamified version of the test, players receive a score for correctly selected target stimuli, points being awarded in proportion to reaction time and penalties for missed or incorrect selections. High scores are shared between locations. Questions were embedded to probe self-awareness about \u2018attention span\u2019 in relation to playing the game, awareness of ADHD and Adult ADHD and increase in knowledge from the video. Results are presented on the level of public engagement with the game and video, deduced from play statistics, answers to the questions and scores obtained across the screen locations. Awareness of Adult ADHD specifically was similar to ADHD in general and knowledge increased overall for 93 % of video viewers. Furthermore, ratings of knowledge of Adult ADHD correlated positively with ADHD in general and positively with knowledge gain. Average scores varied amongst the sites but there was no significant correlation of question ratings with score. The challenge of interpreting user results from unsupervised platforms is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Serious games (SGs) have emerged in recent years as a key method to augment education and training. SGs allow players to experience new concepts while exploring engaging virtual environments. To further extend the educational merit of SGs, adaptive SGs integrate games with adaptive systems to provide a more supportive education. Typically, these adaptive systems either focus on assisting or engaging the player, or on providing a more human-like tutoring experience. For appropriate adaptation, these games make use of player analytics and player modeling to determine what help to provide, predict future player actions, or otherwise model a player\u2019s mental or physical state. To assist researchers in the development of future adaptive SGs, this article reviews and categorizes both player modeling and game adaptation methods from publications over the past ten years. We offer comparisons of various methods to achieve both modeling and adaptation, as well as comprehensive categories for both aspects. Furthermore, we also offer insights for future areas of study in adaptive SGs, as well as possible directions for SG developers.",

        "abstract": "Serious games are growing rapidly as a gaming industry as well as a field of academic research. There are many surveys in the field of digital serious games; however, most surveys are specific to a particular area such as education or health. So far, there has been little work done to survey digital serious games in general, which is the main goal of this paper. Hence, we discuss relevant work on serious games in different application areas including education, well-being, advertisement, cultural heritage, interpersonal communication, and health care. We also propose a taxonomy for digital serious games, and we suggest a classification of reviewed serious games applications from the literature against the defined taxonomy. Finally, the paper provides guidelines, drawn from the literature, for the design and development of successful serious games, as well as discussing research perspectives in this domain.",

The game level focuses on the concept of 'operator precedence'. The player travels through a multilevel 3- dimensional maze and at each junction in the maze he/she is required to solve a mathematical problem that involves the application of operator precedence rules. A correct answer allows the player to move closer to the maze exit, an incorrect solution moves the player farther from the end of the maze. Initial findings from a formative study with a group of 14 undergraduate students show that the game level is usable, engaging and useful for learning/reviewing the intended programming concept.",

        "abstract": "Background. The effectiveness of digital game-based learning is an important issue. Mobile learning games (MLG) are rapidly growing trends among the digital game-based learning genre. Although many studies have been conducted and mobile games have been shown to have an unquestionable potential as a learning method, their effectiveness has not been fully proven, and the positive impacts and outcomes of mobile learning games with respect to learning have yet to be investigated. Aim. The study aimed at capturing the cognitive learning outcomes and the process of knowledge acquisition. The study has demonstrated both positive and negative cognitive learning effects of using mobile learning game in comparison with the textbook learning process. Methodology. This article presents a comparative study conducted on a group of 160 freshman students majoring in management and finance. The participants of the study, divided into subgroups, were taught using either textbook-based learning or a mobile learning game. Three tests were applied to measure their performance: a pre-test at the beginning of the experiment, and two post-tests, the first administered directly after the learning process and the second 2-3 weeks after the initial learning. Results and recommendations. MLG have been proven to create many positive effect for learning. It is as effective in transferring factual knowledge as textbook learning, when measured directly after the learning process. In longer term, the effects are blurred because the affective effects interfere with the measurement.",
